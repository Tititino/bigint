# bigint
(WIP)

C static library to work with arbitrary length numbers. For now it only support naturals with sum and multiplication.

I plan on adding:
  * negative numbers support
  * fixed point numbers support
  * FFT for multiplication

Also this library kinda sucks and the multiplication, addition and parsing algorithms can surely be optimized.
